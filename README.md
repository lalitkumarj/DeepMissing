# Installation of PyTorch

It's important to have python3 installed. The pytorch installation is [here](http://pytorch.org/) (unless you have a `conda` environment, it's probably best to use the `pip` installer).

You will also need `jupyer` installed. This can be done with `pip update; pip install jupyter`. Then navigate to the this directory and just run `jupyter notebook`.
